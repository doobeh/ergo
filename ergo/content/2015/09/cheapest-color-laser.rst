This is a guide showing you how the `Dell C3765dnf`_ or `Dell C3760dn`_
can be used to be give you the cheapest cost per page of any
printer on the market.  It feels like a glitch in the system
and it honestly fills me with joy when I covert people and businesses
over to using this range and methods.

I base this of years of trial and error.  I've used higher-end Dell
printers with poorer results, and I've also used Samsung, HP and Canon
printer with varying degrees of success.  We print high quantities of
full color, double sided images-- usually around 20 thousand imprints
in a four day period.

We've gradually grown to using a bank of six of these printers to enable
us to print huge quantities in quick batches, and to share the wear-and-tear
on the mechanics (read on!).

The short and long of it are that the `Dell C3765dnf`_ or if you don't
require fax or scanning
capabilities the `Dell C3760dn`_ are the absolute best printers you can buy.

The `Dell C3765dnf`_ is well priced if you can get it for under $600,
if it's currently listed at more then that on Amazon (I've seen it as high
as $950) then just wait and you'll get a better deal in a week or two.

The `Dell C3760dn`_ is usually around $350, at that price it almost feels
like stealing.  Your cost for operation will very quickly pay back the
upfront cost.  The difference between the two is solely in the scanner/print
options.  The C3765dnf has them (the 'f' is the indicator) while the C3760
is purely a color printer.

Honestly, if you do require a great scanner, the best combination is
to get the `Dell C3760dn`_ and a `Fujitsu SnapScan iX500`_ but for most
small offices, there's definite benefits from having it all in a single
unit, and that's why the `Dell C3765dnf`_ exists.

Savings
~~~~~~~

Rule number one: never, ever use OEM printer toner-- it's a razor blade
business model, they sell you the printer cheap and hope to make it up
on the consumables.  You can break that cycle.

There are a multitude of vendors that sell compatible toner.  The best one
I've used, and continue to use is the `LD Toner`_ which costs around $145
for a full set of refills, allowing you to print around 9k pages of
office colour (think word documents with graphs and inset graphics)
which in turns works out to be about 1.5c per colour page.

We do a great deal of true full-color printing, and I estimate I can
print at under 5c per page, which is pretty much unheard of.

When you order a set of `LD Toner`_ from Amazon, they'll come with a
coupon code in the box.  If you then order directly from LD's website
then you can save a further 5% or so.  If you don't need the toner
urgently, then that's a good option.  I've had two bad instances when
my 'next day' shipment from LD direct actually left two weeks later, every
time I've ordered via Amazon, it's shipped the same day.

Rule Two: know when to quit.

The printer has four consumables:

1.  Toner (Change every 5-9k pages as they run out)
2.  Imaging Drums (Change every 20-35k pages)
3.  Waste Toner (Change every 20-35k pages)
4.  Paper

The toner and paper is cheap, keep reordering and using that as required.

The Imaging
Drums are the most sensitive piece-- if you're in an office that
does print mostly spreadsheets or text documents then the imaging drum
will actually give you 30k pages between changes, if you print more full-color
pages, that can drop down to 10k pages.  The yellow one always dies first.

Don't buy the imaging drums off Amazon, they can't be trusted to be
non-refurbed units and you need honest-to-God fresh ones to make
sure everything works as it should.  Buy them `here from Dell`_ they
cost $149.99 and they usually appear within about five business days.
(Dell mentions next-day-business, but they really mean "next-day-business
once it leaves our warehouse").

The `Waste toner containers`_ are cheap at $25 and they rarely need replacing.
You can even vacuum out a full one to bring it back to new, but just make
sure you have a HEPA filter on your vacuum.

I mentioned "know when to quit".  Keep track of what you have spent on the printer
and how many pages it has printed. Just tape a sheet to the side of it, and each time
you replace a toner, imaging unit, waste container or ream of paper-- log it.

If you're in a usual office that price per page calculation
is going to drop to less then 2c per page within a year. When it does ask yourself
the serious question of "Should I run this printer into the ground, or should I buy
a new one?". The new one obviously comes with new imaging units ($149) and a fresh
waste toner container ($25) and even low-capacity toner cartridges (estimate about $40).

If you initially bought the `Dell C3765dnf`_ then I really recommend buying the `Dell C3760dn`_
as a backup/secondary printer-- as I mentioned above it's only $319 and comes with $214 worth
of consumables, so it's a great time to pick up the extra capacity for only $100 real cost.
